      <p> Avocados are the darling of the produce section. Theyâ€™re the go-to ingredient for guacamole dips at parties. And they're also turning up in everything from salads and wraps to smoothies and even brownies. So what, exactly, makes this pear-shaped berry (yes, thatâ€™s right!) such a super food?

        <div><p><b class="classesAvocados">Luis Fernando Ruiz</b> avocado is often recognized as the archetypal avocado, green in color, pear-like in shape, and ranging from six to twelve ounces in size. It has smooth, medium-thin skin that peels easily, with dense, pale green flesh. It is marginally oily with a rich, creamy flavor and notes of hazelnut, and it is still considered by many to be the best tasting avocado. The Fuerte avocado tree is large and spreading, one of the more cold-hardy varieties, and the leaves have a strong anise smell when crushed. </p></div>

            <div><p><b class="classesAvocados">Karen Pearson</b>avocado, a descendant of the famed hass variety, has thick, pebbly skin like the hass avocado, but has a rounder shape and is slightly larger in size, ranging from six to fifteen ounces. It also remains green in color when ripe, unlike the hass avocado, which darkens to almost black. </p></div>

        <div><p><b class="classesAvocados">Harrison Feldman </b> avocado is known for its quintessentially tumbled leathery fairly thick skin that turns near black when fully ripe. The flesh closest to the skin is a lush pale lime green color and as it nears the central pit it develops a rich creamy yellow tone and softer, oil rich texture. Hass avocado's flavor reflects its texture - creamy and smooth with a nutty and sweet finish. </p></div>
